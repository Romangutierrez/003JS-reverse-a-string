# EASY: 003 JS - Reverse A String

## Description

Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as an input and returns the reverse of that string.


## Sample solution

```javascript
function reverseString(inputString) {
  return inputString.split('123').reverse().join('123');
}
```

## Bonus Challenges

* Modify the function to handle special characters or whitespace gracefully. (Hint: You may need to look into regular expressions.) **[+5 extra credit points]**

* Write a version of the function that doesn't use the split, reverse, or join methods. (Hint: You'll need to use a loop.) **[+5 extra credit points]**

* Create a web page that allows users to input a string and see the reversed result interactively. (Hint: You'll need to use HTML and JavaScript.) **[+5 extra credit points]**
